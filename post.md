🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **CommandHub – All-in-One Command & Tool Platform using Streamlit!** 🐧

CommandHub is a centralized platform that allows you to **execute, manage, and monitor essential Linux system commands and tools from a web interface**.

🔹 **Key Features:**
- Comprehensive **System Analysis** (CPU, Memory, Disk, Processes, Network)
- **GUI Analysis** – Identify underlying commands of running Linux GUI applications
- **Icon & Logo Management** – Locate and modify app icons
- **Terminal Enhancement** – Add advanced terminals & shell customization (tmux, zsh, fish)
- **Communication Tools** – Send Email, WhatsApp, Tweet, SMS (mock/demo)
- **Documentation Hub** – Generate blogs and technical documentation for Linux concepts
- **Signal Handling** – Learn how Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP) work under the hood

💡 **Tech Stack:**
- Python 3
- Streamlit for web UI
- psutil for system monitoring
- subprocess, platform, os for cross-platform operations

🔹 **Why I built it:**
Linux provides powerful tools, but managing them individually can be overwhelming. This project brings **automation, monitoring, and analysis together** in one interactive platform.

📌 **Run it on your Linux system:**
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Sayantan2k24/CommandHub-System-Python.git`

2. Setup Python & virtual environment
  python3 -m venv my_streamlit_env
  source my_streamlit_env/bin/activate
  pip3 install streamlit

4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Launch: `streamlit run commandhub.py`

This project is perfect for **Linux enthusiasts, system admins, and anyone curious about command-line automation and system monitoring**.
